Assignment 1 - Revisiting basic of ML and DL

## Training and I/O Optimization: 
We analyzed the impact of data loader worker count on training efficiency for a ResNet-18 model on CIFAR-10 using PyTorch. By sweeping worker counts at different step sizes, we observed variations in optimal values. We developed an adaptive worker allocation strategy based on system metrics like CPU/GPU utilization. This approach aims to improve training speed by dynamically adjusting the number of workers.

- Findings:
A coarse-grained sweep (step of 4) suggested an optimal worker count of 4, while a fine-grained sweep (step of 1) found 2 to be better. This highlights that worker optimization requires finer tuning for best efficiency. ðŸš€
